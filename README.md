# Cyber Portfolio – Therese Chambers (Reztech)

This repository documents my hands-on learning and practical experience across cybersecurity, networking, and cloud fundamentals.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate **how I think**, not just what tools or certifications I have.  
Each entry focuses on problem identification, decision-making, troubleshooting steps, and lessons learned.

## What you’ll find here
- Troubleshooting case studies (real-world scenarios)
- Networking and cybersecurity labs
- Cloud fundamentals and architecture notes
- Clear documentation written for both technical and non-technical audiences

This portfolio will continue to evolve as I complete additional labs, certifications, and projects.
